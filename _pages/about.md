I'm a Intermediate Engineer from NLPR, [Institute of Automation](https://ia.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D-lKLcMAAAAJ), [Prof. Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Liang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8kzzUboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of NLPR Lab from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was advised by [Prof. Yuanping Chen](https://cnic.cas.cn/sourcedb_cnic_cas/zw/zjrc/dsdw/202107/t20210702_6125751.html) and [Prof. Xiaoqian Zhu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=1zMMq0QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from [Computer Network Information Center](https://cnic.cas.cn/), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I obtained my postgraduate degree.

My research focuses on deep learning, natural language processing, and agent augmentation, particularly in event extraction, fact-checking, graph learning, tool and retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, I have extended my interest to multi-modal foundation models in AI4Science. Ultimately, I aspire to push foundation models toward real-world interactionâ€”through tool-use via code generation, visual reasoning for scientific tasks, and world modeling for physical or embodied simulation.

You can find my CV here: [CV](../assets/YunyueSu.pdf).

I am currently exploring Ph.D. opportunities, and would be excited to explore any potential fit with your ongoing projects. Please feel free to contact me: [Wechat](../images/wechat.png)
